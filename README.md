# HB_Transcriptomics_FinalProject.R

Overview:
In this project, I have 2 omics datasets (transcriptomics and epigenomics) from several asthma cases. The epigenomic data here is a measure of the DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides.Â 
Project Objective: DNA methylation is known to suppress gene expression. My task is to see if this is true for Asthma patients.
1.I will perform differential expression between the healthy and asthmatic patients to identify the highly expressed and lowly expressed genes.
2.I will visualize the methylation pattern of the highly expressed genes and lowly expressed genes.
3.I will check if methylation affected expression.
4.I will perform functional enrichment for genes with high expression and low methylation and vice versa to observe the  type of cells that are enriched.
During this project, I will build an R script using R version 4.2.2 and RStudio version 2022.07.2+576.
